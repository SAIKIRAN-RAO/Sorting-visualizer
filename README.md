# Sorting Visualizer Web Application

![Sorting Visualizer Demo](link-to-demo-gif.gif)

## Description

The Sorting Visualizer Web Application is an interactive tool that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It demonstrates how different sorting algorithms rearrange elements within a list to bring them into their correct order. This application is implemented using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for styling.

## Features

- Visual representation of sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort.
- Interactive user interface: Users can adjust the size of the input array, choose a sorting algorithm, and control the sorting speed.
- Real-time visualization: The web application provides a real-time visualization of the sorting process, making it easy for users to understand how each algorithm works.
- Random data generation: Users can generate a random array to visualize the sorting algorithms with different inputs.
- Step-by-step analysis: The application highlights each step of the sorting process, enabling users to observe and analyze the algorithm's performance.
